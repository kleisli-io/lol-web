(defstruct extractor-spec
  "One extractor declaration from a defhandler lambda list.

   NAME — symbol bound in the handler body. When SOURCE-STRING is NIL, drives
     the default lookup key as (string-downcase (symbol-name name)).
   KIND — keyword used as the eql-method specializer for RESOLVE-EXTRACTOR.
     Built-ins: :path :query :body :header :json-body. User-extensible.
   TYPE — symbol naming the target Lisp type for coercion. T means no coercion
     (raw string for string-sourced extractors, raw value for JSON-sourced).
     Built-in coercions: integer, boolean, keyword, symbol.
   REQUIRED-P — when T, missing input signals MISSING-EXTRACTOR-INPUT (422).
     When NIL and DEFAULT is NIL, missing input resolves to NIL.
   DEFAULT — function of zero args, or NIL. When non-NIL and the source is
     missing, the function is called and its value used (no coercion). The
     macro lifts the user-supplied default form into a thunk so the form is
     evaluated at request time, not at registration time.
   SOURCE-STRING — string overriding the default lookup key. Required for
     header names that don't match the symbol name (e.g. \"X-API-Key\" for
     a parameter bound to API-KEY).
   CUSTOM-RESOLVER — symbol naming a function that takes (SPEC ENV PATH-PARAMS)
     and returns the resolved value, or NIL. When non-NIL, the resolver
     function is invoked instead of dispatching on KIND. Lets one-off extractors
     bypass the CLOS protocol when a method-add would be heavyweight."
