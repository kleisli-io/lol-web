;;; Reactive primitives are SINGLE-THREADED by default. *current-effect*,
;;; *batch-depth*, *pending-effects*, and the per-signal subscribers tables
;;; are global mutable state — concurrent threads sharing a signal graph
;;; race on those. A typical web request runs on its own thread and never
;;; crosses signal boundaries, so no wrapper is needed. To share signals
;;; across threads, wrap reactive call sites in WITH-LOL-WEB-THREAD-SAFETY.

(defparameter *current-effect* nil
  "The currently executing effect (for automatic dependency tracking).
   When an effect function runs, accessing any signal automatically
   subscribes that effect to future changes.")

(defparameter *current-effect-register* nil
  "When inside an effect that tracks its subscriptions for clean disposal,
   this holds a unary function. Reactive sources call it with their
   subscribers hash-table whenever they record *current-effect* as a
   subscriber, so the effect's dispose path can later drop those
   subscriptions and stop being re-run.")

(defparameter *batch-depth* 0
  "When > 0, defer effect execution until batch completes.
   This allows multiple state changes without intermediate re-renders.
   Read-modify-write — not safe under concurrent access without
   WITH-LOL-WEB-THREAD-SAFETY.")

(defparameter *pending-effects* '()
  "Effects waiting to run after batch completes. Mutated by signal setters
   during batched updates — not safe under concurrent access without
   WITH-LOL-WEB-THREAD-SAFETY.")

(defvar *thread-safety-lock*
  (bordeaux-threads:make-lock "lol-reactive thread-safety")
