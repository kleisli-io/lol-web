;;;; Regression tests for :lol-web/client-runtime.
;;;;
;;;; The single exported function `lol-reactive-runtime-js` concatenates
;;;; outputs from htmx (`htmx-runtime-js`), html (`reactive-runtime-js`),
;;;; and realtime-htmx (`ws-client-js`, `sse-client-js`, `optimistic-js`).
;;;; Smoke-level coverage: actually invoke it and check the output is a
;;;; substantive non-empty string containing landmarks from each source.
