;;;; Regression tests for :lol-web/resources.
;;;;
;;;; The package exports nothing today — every symbol is internal — so
;;;; tests use `lol-web/resources::` qualifiers throughout. Coverage:
;;;; resource-state predicates, defresource macroexpansion contract,
;;;; cache key shape, and clear-resource-cache scope.
